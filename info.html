          Volcanic Eruption :

            VOLCANIC ERUPTION: BUSINESS



            how can a Volcanic Eruption affect business:


            Volcanic ashfalls, like other natural disasters, are unplanned events that can disrupt businesses.
            Ashfall can cause physical damage to buildings, equipment, computers, machinery, vehicles, inventory, and supplies,
            and can cause a temporary shutdown of business operations (hours to days or longer). Furthermore,
            a series of explosive eruptions over a period of weeks to months can result in multiple ashfalls, 
            necessitating costly 

            cleanup operations after each one. One of the most important 
            steps to take to mitigate the potential effects of ash and improve the response and
            recovery of a business to ashfall is to create a general plan for dealing with emergencies and a specific plan for ashfall. 
            Resources for developing emergency and contingency plans are available elsewhere.

            Businesses and organizations should consider their vulnerability to volcanic ashfalls during non-eruptive periods.
             Mitigation strategies can be developed after the vulnerability has been assessed. (Johnston and Becker, 2001)
              There are three types of approaches that can be used:

            Policy and management measures that reduce the likelihood of damage or failure of equipment from volcanic ash.
            Engineering design measures that reduce vulnerability to ash.
            Preparedness and response planning to deal with ashfall and cleanup activities.

            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

            VOLCANIC ERUPTION TIPS
            -----------------------

            1) Limit your time outdoors and use a dust mask or cloth mask as a last resort.
            2) Avoid areas downwind and river valleys downstream of the volcano.
            3) Take temporary shelter from volcanic ash where you are.
            4) Cover ventilation openings and seal doors and windows.
            5) Avoid driving in heavy ash.

            EARTHQUAKE: BUSINESS 



            how do Earthquakes affect business

            For starters, earthquakes can activate sprinkler systems and breakwater lines, 
            both of which can cause water to cascade onto important business files.
            Gas lines can also be damaged by earthquakes. Leaking gas can explode into a 
            fire with a single spark, destroying irreplaceable documents and other
            business assets. Smoke can also harm items that haven't been affected by the flames.
            Furthermore, seismic activity has the potential to loosen unstable soil, 
            resulting in mudslides and flash floods. Even businesses located far from the epicenter of a quake may be affected.

            Even if a business is left with mountains of flood-damaged books and documents 
            as a result of an earthquake, document scanning services can repair damaged papers
            using desiccant air drying and vacuum freeze-drying. Even so, creating a workaround 
            for flood-damaged documents and books before a disaster is less expensive.

            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

            EARTHQUAKES TIPS
            -------------------

            1) Drop to the ground. Grab your emergency kit.
            2) Cover. Get under your dining room table or desk. If there isn’t a table or desk near you, 
            cover your face and head with your arms and crouch in an inside corner of the building.
            3) Hold On. Stay inside and in place until shaking stops. Research has shown that most 
            injuries occur when people inside buildings attempt to move to a different location inside the building or try to leave.
            4) If you’re outside get away from buildings which can collapse. Stay in an open 
            area like a field where there are no trees, buildings or power lines.
            5) If you’re at school, work or any area with an elevator, and the shaking has 
            stopped, when you leave don’t take the elevator. Take the stairs.

            HURRICANE: BUSINESS








            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

            HURRICANE TIPS
            -----------------

            1) Stay indoors and away from windows and glass doors.
            2) Close all interior doors—secure and brace external doors.
            3) Keep curtains and blinds closed.
            4) Take refuge in a small interior room, closet, or hallway on the lowest level.
            5) Lie on the floor under a table or another sturdy object.
            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            TSUNAIMI: BUSINESS








            

            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

            TSUNAMI TIPS: 
            -----------------

            1) Get to high ground as far inland as possible.
            2) Be alert to signs of a tsunami, such as a sudden rise or draining of ocean waters.
            3) Listen to emergency information and alerts.
            4) Evacuate: DO NOT wait!
            5) If you are in a boat, go out to sea.

            <p>A volcano is a crack or opening in the earth's surface through which magma (hot liquid or semi-liquid rock),<br> volcanic ash, and gases can escape. They are most commonly seen where tectonic plates collide or divide, but volcanic hotspots can also cause them to form  in the midst <br>of plates. A volcanic eruption occurs when a volcano releases lava and gas, sometimes explosively. A 'glowing avalanche,' which occurs when newly erupted lava slides down the flanks of a volcano, is the most deadly sort of eruption. They have the ability to travel swiftly and reach temperatures of up to 1,200°F. Ash fall and lahars are two other dangers (mud or debris flows). Volcanoes frequently result in human dislocation and food scarcity.</p>
