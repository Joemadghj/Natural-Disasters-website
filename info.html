              <h1 id="sec-1">Volcanic Eruption</h1>
              <p id="sec-1"><strong>A volcano is a crack or opening in the earth's surface through which magma (hot liquid or semi-liquid rock), volcanic ash, and gases can escape. They are most commonly seen where tectonic plates collide or divide, but volcanic hotspots can also cause them to form in the midst of plates. A volcanic eruption occurs when a volcano releases lava and gas, sometimes explosively. A 'glowing avalanche,' which occurs when newly erupted lava slides down the flanks of a volcano, is the most deadly sort of eruption. They have the ability to travel swiftly and reach temperatures of up to 1,200°F. Ash fall and lahars are two other dangers (mud or debris flows). Volcanoes frequently result in human dislocation and food scarcity.</strong></p><br>
              <h1 id="sec-1">How Volcanoes Erupt?</h1><br>
              <p id="sec-1"><strong>All volcanoes share the same basic features. The magma collects in magma chambers that can be 160 kilometers (100 miles) beneath the surface. As the rock heats, it expands, which creates even more pressure. As a result, the magma seeks a way out pushing toward the surface, the magma seeping through cracks in the Earth’s crust called vents. Eventually, the magma reaches the surface; when it comes out, we call it an eruption. The word eruption is used in other contexts, as well. An eruption can be an outburst or explosion, a violent and sudden occurrence, like when a crowd erupts in anger. But an eruption can also be a spreading of something like a rash on your skin, gradual and relatively calm. These two definitions are similar to the two kinds of eruptions that we see in volcanoes.</strong></p><br>
              <h1 id="sec-1">how can a Volcanic Eruption affect business?</h1><br>
              <p id="sec-1"><strong>Volcanic ash falls, like other natural disasters, are unplanned events that can disrupt businesses. Ashfall can cause physical damage to buildings, equipment, computers, machinery, vehicles, inventory, and supplies, and can cause a temporary shutdown of business operations (hours to days or longer). Furthermore, a series of explosive eruptions over a period of weeks to months can result in multiple ashfalls, necessitating costly cleanup operations after each one. One of the most important steps to take to mitigate the potential effects of ash and improve the response and recovery of a business to ashfall is to create a general plan for dealing with emergencies and a specific plan for ashfall. Resources for developing emergency and contingency plans are available elsewhere.

                Businesses and organisations should consider their vulnerability to volcanic ash falls during non-eruptive periods. Mitigation strategies can be developed after the vulnerability has been assessed. (Johnston and Becker, 2001) There are three types of approaches that can be used:
                <br>Policy and management measures that reduce the likelihood of damage or failure of equipment from volcanic ash.
                Engineering design measures that reduce vulnerability to ash.
                Preparedness and response planning to deal with ashfall and cleanup activities.
              </strong></p><br>
              <h1 id="sec-1">STATISTICS</h1>
              <p id="sec-1"><strong>More than 80% of the earth's surface is made up of volcanic rock. Numerous volcanic explosions shaped the sea floor and some mountains. The earth's atmosphere was produced by gaseous eruptions from volcanoes.
                There are over 500 active volcanoes scattered around the world mostly found near the pacific ocean.
                Every year, approximately 50-70 volcanoes erupt on average. Some of them explode more than once, while others only erupt once. The average number of separate eruptions every year is somewhere between 60 and 80.
                A graph that shows how many volcanoes erupt per year from 1790 to 1990. A dramatic increase in the number of eruptions can be seen through the years. </strong></p><br>

              <h1 id="sec-1">How to survive it?</h1>
              <p id="sec-1"><strong>1) Drop to the ground. Grab your emergency kit.</p></strong>
              <p id="sec-1"><strong>2) Cover. Get under your dining room table or desk. If there isn’t a table or desk near you, cover your face and head with your arms and crouch in an inside corner of the building.</p></strong>
              <p id="sec-1"><strong>3) Hold On. Stay inside and in place until shaking stops. Research has shown that most injuries occur when people inside buildings attempt to move to a different location inside the building or try to leave</p></strong>
              <p id="sec-1"><strong>4)  If you’re outside get away from buildings which can collapse. Stay in an open area like a field where there are no trees, buildings or power lines.</p></strong>
              <p id="sec-1"><strong>5) If you’re at school, work or any area with an elevator, and the shaking has stopped, when you leave don’t take the elevator. Take the stairs.</p></strong>

              <h1 id="sec-2">Earthquakes</h1>
              <p id="sec-2"><strong>An earthquake (also called a quake, tremor, or temblor) is the shaking of the Earth's surface caused by a sudden release of energy in the lithosphere, which results in seismic waves. Earthquakes can range in size from those that are too little to be felt to those that are powerful enough to throw things and people into the air and destroy entire towns. The number, nature, and size of earthquakes experienced in a given area is referred to as seismicity, or seismic activity. Non-earthquake seismic rumbling is also referred to as tremor.</strong></p><br>
              <h1 id="sec-2">What causes earthquakes and where do they happen?</h1><br>
              <p id="sec-2"><strong>The earth has four major layers: the inner core, outer core, mantle and crust. The crust and the top of the mantle make up a thin skin on the surface of our planet.</strong></p><br>
              <h1 id="sec-2">how do Earthquakes affect business?</h1><br>
              <p id="sec-2"><strong><br>For starters, earthquakes can activate sprinkler systems and breakwater lines, both of which can cause water to cascade onto important business files.

                Gas lines can also be damaged by earthquakes. Leaking gas can explode into a fire with a single spark, destroying irreplaceable documents and other business assets. Smoke can also harm items that haven't been affected by the flames.
                
                Furthermore, seismic activity has the potential to loosen unstable soil, resulting in mudslides and flash floods. Even businesses located far from the epicentre of a quake may be affected.
                
                Even if a business is left with mountains of flood-damaged books and documents as a result of an earthquake, document scanning services can repair damaged papers using desiccant air drying and vacuum freeze-drying. Even so, creating a workaround for flood-damaged documents and books before a disaster is less expensive.
              </strong></p><br>
              <h1 id="sec-2">STATISTICS</h1><br>
              <p id="sec-2"><strong>Earthquakes usually occur on the edges of large sections of the Earth's crust called tectonic plates.
                Each year, there are an estimated 500,000 earthquakes that can be detected around the world. There are 100,000 of them, and 100 of them inflict damage.
                Earthquakes usually happen around the west side of the earth in the bottom part of North America and the top part of South America. Earthquakes also commonly occur in Asia around Indonesia, Japan, and Pakistan.</strong></p><br>
              <h1 id="sec-2">How to survive it?</h1><br>
              <p id="sec-2"><strong>1) Limit your time outdoors and use a dust mask or cloth mask as a last resort.</p></strong>
              <p id="sec-2"><strong>2) Avoid areas downwind and river valleys downstream of the volcano.</p></strong>
              <p id="sec-2"><strong>3) Take temporary shelter from volcanic ash where you are.</p></strong>

              <p id="sec-3"><strong>A tropical cyclone is a low-pressure weather system that rotates around the earth and has structured thunderstorms but no fronts (a boundary separating two air masses of different densities). Tropical depressions are tropical cyclones with maximum sustained surface winds of less than 39 miles per hour (mph). Tropical storms are defined as storms having maximum sustained winds of 39 mph or above.</strong></p><br>
              <h1 id="sec-3">how are hurricanes formed?</h1><br>
              <p id="sec-3"><strong>Tropical cyclones are created from warm, moist air above the ocean waters near the equator. The rising warm air creates an area of lower air pressure and air from surrounding areas with higher air pressure pushes into this lower pressure area.</strong></p><br>

              <p id="sec-3"><strong>Hurricanes that cause significant damage may force a business to close for days or even weeks while repairs are made, resulting in a revenue loss that may be difficult to recover from. Few businesses can afford to close their doors for an extended period of time and expect to stay in business.

                How Some Businesses May Benefit
                
                While some businesses, particularly those in the service industry, may benefit from a hurricane, for the most part, these storms only cause business interruptions that can last for months.
                
                In many cases, it is the profit boost that these industries provide that attracts an entrepreneur to a specific location. If you're willing to put up with the inconveniences of hurricanes and tropical storms, such a move could pay off handsomely. Many of these businesses in hurricane-prone areas rely on the five-and-a-half-month hurricane season between June and November to generate the majority of their annual revenue.
              </strong></p><br>
              <h1 id="sec-3">STATISTICS</h1><br>
              <p id="sec-3"><strong>Hurricanes are enormous, swirling tropical storms with wind speeds of more than 160 mph and the ability to pour more than 2.4 trillion gallons of rain each day.
                In the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, and Gulf of Mexico, an average of ten tropical storms form each year. Many of these are still floating in the ocean. Each year, six of these storms develop into hurricanes.
                Hurricanes happen consistently per year with minor rising and falling in number of occurrences.

              <p id="sec-4"><strong>A tsunami is a sequence of extraordinarily long waves created by a huge and sudden shift in the ocean floor, which is usually caused by an earthquake beneath or near the ocean floor. This force generates waves that travel in all directions away from their source, spanning entire ocean basins in the process. Tsunamis travel through the entire water column, from the ocean floor to the ocean surface, unlike wind-driven waves, which only travel through the highest layer of the.</strong></p><br>
              <h1 id="sec-4">How does a Tsunami occur?</h1><br>
              <p id="sec-4"><strong>A tsunami is a series of long, high sea waves caused by a disturbance in the water. This disturbance can come about in many ways such as an earthquake, landslide, volcanic eruption, or meteorite. The most common causes are volcanic or earthquake activity, and the disturbance itself causes abrupt movement of the water column.Tsunamis are different to the ordinary undersea currents, as these are caused by the gravitational pull of the Moon and Sun, resulting in tides, while some sea waves are caused by the wind. Moreover, tsunamis do not take after normal waves as they have a much longer wavelength (distance between successive peaks).
              </strong></p><br>
              <h1 id="sec-4">how can Tsunamis affect business?</h1><br>
              <p id="sec-4"><strong>Many businesses will be unable to trade immediately after a tsunami disaster due to the destruction of their premises, stock, machinery, facilities, transportation networks, supplies, and staff. All sectors of the business community are likely to be impacted, albeit to varying degrees (see Table 2). Loss of agricultural production (due to a variety of factors such as crop loss, soil contamination, destruction of market and distribution networks, and loss of livestock populations) can have significant economic consequences, particularly for developing countries and small island states that rely heavily on agriculture.</strong></p><br>
              <h1 id="sec-4">STATISTICS</h1><br>
              <p id="sec-4"><strong>Tsunamis killed more than 250 000 people worldwide between 1998 and 2017, including more than 227 000 people in the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004.

                Tsunamis can travel thousands of kilometers and reach speeds of up to 800 km/h. They can have disastrous effects on the town once they reach the coast.
                Most tsunamis usually happen around the pacific ocean and nearby countries so over 700 million people live in low-lying coastal regions that are vulnerable to extreme sea-level disasters such as tsunamis.
                
                Tsunamis may travel thousands of kilometers and reach speeds of up to 800 km/h. They can have disastrous effects on the town once they reach the coast. Several crests can appear at periods of 10 to 45 minutes, wreaking havoc for several hours.</strong></p>
